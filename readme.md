# JS Image Maker

`npm i`
`node runMe.js`


- uses jimp to generate an image for ammo.lol

- custom fonts can be changed however you need to use a tool like <a href="https://libgdx.com/wiki/tools/hiero">Hiero</a>, download the ttf file and use Hiero to turn it into a fnt file, pute the png and fnt file and alter the code to locate those files
